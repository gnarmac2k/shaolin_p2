Using Machine Learning Methods to Create a Movie Recommendation System
<br> - Requirements & Guidelines: https://github.com/ShaolinAI/AI-ML-Bootcamp-Jun-2023/tree/main/03-Projects/Project-02
<br> - used a lot of code from here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamesloy/deep-learning-based-recommender-systems
<br> - what we're creating: a movie recommendation site
<br> - how it works: using unique language in a given film's description we match it with other films with a similar description
<br> - data source: not sure, TMBD? scrape IMDB?
<br> - site allows user to query or click on a title and see related movies
